    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
<p class="intro">Hi, my name is Jose Flores. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. 
Both of my parents are from El Salvador. <span class="sentence">They moved to Los Angeles to escape a war that was happening in their country.</span> 
It was a hard time in El Salvador, and many people left to find safety.</p>

<p>Growing up in L.A., I was around people from many different cultures. 
I learned about different foods, holidays, and traditions. 
Most of my friends were Mexican-American, so I didn’t feel very connected to my Salvadoran roots. 
I was raised both Christian and Catholic, and I listened to salsa and ranchera music at home.</p>

<p>I’ve always enjoyed art, music, and movies. I like to draw, and I play the drums. 
Being creative has always been fun for me. I went to college and earned a degree in film. 
I enjoy using Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and working with visual effects.</p>

<p>Right now, I work at Frito Lay in the warehouse. 
Some of my coworkers are studying tech and are majoring in cybersecurity or IT. 
It because of them what got me interested in this field. I’m excited to learn more and grow. 
It’s been a tough journey, but I believe I can do it. 
I just need to study hard, stay focused, and learn as much as I can from my professors.</p>
