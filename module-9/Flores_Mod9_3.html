       <p>Hi, my name is Jose Flores. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. 
          It’s a big city with people from many different places. My parents are from <span id = "El Salvador">_________</span>, 
          a small country in Central America. They immigrated to the United States during a time of 
          deep political unrest and civil war. Fearing for their safety and dreaming of a better future, 
          they left behind everything they knew: their family, their culture, and their language, 
          to start fresh in a new country. That experience shaped not only their lives, but mine as well.</p>

       <button type="button"
       onclick="document.getElementById('El Salvador').innerHTML = firstVariableValue">
       Reveal</button>

       <p id="El Salvador"></p>

	<p>Growing up in L.A. was interesting. I met people from many different cultures. 
	   Most of my friends were <span id = "Mexican-American">_________</span>, I spent a lot of time with them, so I 
           learned about their food, music, and holidays. We ate tacos, listened to mariachi music, 
           and celebrated special days like Día de los Muertos. Because I was around Mexican culture so much, 
           I didn’t feel very close to my own Salvadoran background. But as I got older, I wanted to learn more 
           about where my parents came from.</p>

       onclick="document.getElementById('Mexican-American').innerHTML = secondVariableValue">
       Reveal</button>

       <p id="Mexican-American"></p>

       <p>I’ve always liked art, music, and movies. I enjoy drawing, and I also play the drums. 
          Being creative has always been something I love. I went to college and got a degree in film. 
          I enjoy editing videos and working with special effects. I’ve learned how to use programs like 
          <span id = "Adobe Premiere Pro">_________</span> and Photoshop to make cool and creative projects.</p>

       <button type="button"
       onclick="document.getElementById('Adobe Premiere Pro').innerHTML = thirdVariableValue">
       Reveal</button>

       <p id="Adobe Premiere Pro"></p>

       <p>Right now, I work at <span id = "Frito Lay">_________</span> in a warehouse. It’s not my dream job, but it helps me pay the 
          bills and learn how to work hard. Some of my coworkers are studying technology. They are learning 
          about cybersecurity and IT. Talking to them got me interested in the tech field too. Now, 
          I want to learn more about it. I know it won’t be easy, but I’m ready to work hard, study, and grow. 
          I believe I can do it if I stay focused and learn everything I can from my teachers and classmates.</p>
